## Techniques

### ADA - All Day Awareness

### MILD - Mnemonically Induced Lucid Dream

### WILD - Wake-Initiated Lucid Dream

- [FILD - Finger Induced Lucid Dream](https://www.dreamviews.com/induction-techniques/4779-finger-induced-lucid-dream-fild.html) - After WBTB, or when you are very tired and drifting off to sleep, pretend that you are playing piano by lifting up and pressing down with your index and middle fingers, as gently as possible. Perform a reality check every minute or so.

### SSILD - Senses Induced Lucid Dream

### WBTB - Wake Back To Bed

Wake yourself up after 4 to 6 hours of sleep, get out of bed and stay up for anywhere between a few minutes to an hour before going back to bed. Perfrom some reality checks and combine with other techniques when going back to sleep.

### DEILD - Dream Exit Induced Lucid Dream

When you wake up from a dream, try to remain as still as possible and keep your eyes closed, in order to not disturb the neurotransmitters responsible for the dream state. Then imagine and visualize how you would have changed the outcome of the last dream you had if you had known you were dreamin, by flying around in the dream scape or using magical powers.

## Reality Checks

Reality checks are tests that are performed to check if you are dreaming. 

- **Finger Through Hand** - Try to push your index finger through the palm of the other hand.
- **How Did I Get Here** - Recall the steps that got you to your current location.
- **Nose Pinch** - Squeeze your nose closed with your index finger and thumb and try to take a breath.
- **Finger Counting** - Look closely at your hands for any unusual patterns and count your fingers.
- **Levitation** - Imagine what it would feel like to fly around in your surroundings and visualize yourself doing so; after enough daydreaming you will at least have a dream in which you can fly.
